# Predicting customer value using clumpiness: From RFM to RFMC.  
**RFM + C (Clumpiness) for Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**

Companies have been experimenting with various CRM methods to understand the level of loyalty of their own customers. 
RFM analysis has been widely used for the purpose of customer segmentation which R is Recency, F is Frequency and M is Monetary.

However, if you look at Figure 1, although the RFM indicators are the same, the patterns are clearly different.  "User A" regularly purchases but "User B" does not. Therefore, the purchasing patterns cannot be identified by RFM solely.

With the aim of capturing such purchasing patterns, Zhang, Bradlow & Small (2015) of The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania proposed RFMC analysis that added clumpiness index (C) to RFM.
